# Bus Process Simulation

## Description
This program simulates the operation of boarding buses using IPC mechanisms such as child processes, pipes, signals, and message queues. It takes passengers' data from a file and splits them between two buses based on the day of the week.

## Prerequisites

* GCC Compiler (to compile the C program)
* Unix-like Operating System

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate into the directory. 

```
git clone <your-repository-link>
cd <repository-directory>
```

## Usage

1. Compile the C program:

```
gcc -o bus_simulation bus_simulation.c
```

2. Run the executable:

```
./bus_simulation
```

The program reads the passengers' data from the `records.txt` file and simulates two buses picking up passengers. It shows which signal each bus has sent and received and how many passengers each bus has transported.

# Volunteer Schedule Management System

This is a console-based application written in C language. It offers an easy-to-use interface to manage and schedule volunteers for a 12-week long program.

## Program Functions

The program provides the following key functionalities:

1. **Add an Applicant:** The function `addApplicant()` is used to add a volunteer to a particular day and week.

2. **Delete an Applicant:** The function `deleteApplicant()` is used to remove a volunteer from a particular day and week.

3. **Modify an Applicant:** The function `modifyApplicant()` is used to move a volunteer from one day and week to another day and week.

4. **Print Applicant List:** The function `ApplicantList()` is used to print a list of all volunteers.

5. **Initialise File:** The function `initialisingFile()` is used to initialise the records.txt file.

6. **Fill Names:** The function `fillNames()` is used to populate the records.txt file with a list of volunteers.

The program also contains some helper functions such as `print_file_contents()`, `removeDuplicateWords()`, and `delete_word_from_sentence()`.

## How to Use

To use the system:

1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the executable file.
3. Follow the prompts on the console to add, delete, or modify volunteers, or to print the list of volunteers.

## Input

Input data should be provided as per the instructions on the console. When adding or modifying a volunteer, you'll need to provide the name, day, and week number as inputs.

## Output

The output will be printed on the console. You can also find a list of volunteers in the records.txt file.

## Data Storage

The system uses a file named `records.txt` for data storage. Each line in the file represents a week and a day, and the number of volunteers and their names for that particular day.

## Limitations

Currently, the system is designed to handle a 12-week long program with seven days in a week (Monday to Sunday).

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome! If you see something that should be improved, feel free to create a pull request.
