# volunteerManagementSystem
This is a C program for a Volunteer Management System (VMS). It allows adding, deleting, and modifying volunteers for a 12-week period. C code simulates bus boarding using child processes, pipes, signals, and message queues. It reads passengers from a file based on week and day. Great for event scheduling!
